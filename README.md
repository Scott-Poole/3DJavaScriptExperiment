# 3DJavaScriptExperiment

This test project uses THREE.js for drawing 3D objects in the browser and 
CANNON.js for creating world physics (collisions + forces)

use WASD to move and hold SPACE to rise.
The camera takes some getting used to and I know its possible to pass through the walls (and ceiling).
Just refresh to respawn if you start falling through the map.
